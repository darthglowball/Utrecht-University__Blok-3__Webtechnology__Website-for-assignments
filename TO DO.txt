TO DO:
- use <button> with or instead of <a> for navigation?
- aria labels
- alt attributes
- keyboard focus on elements
- make buttons equal size?
- make navigation and content fit between side decorations. Possibly put the side decorations in flexbox?
- page location indicator on navigation buttons
- css variables for more dynamicness
- better class names
- use viewport or font-relative units for position and size
- if you use media queries, use it for the desktop. Mobile css should be default.
- desktop/mobile/tablet layouts
- page content need to fit their parent container
- SEO
