TO DO:
- use <button> with or instead of <a> for navigation?
- aria labels
- alt attributes
- keyboard focus on elements
- make buttons equal size?
- make navigation fit between side decorations. Possibly put the side decorations in flexbox?
- page location indicator on navigation buttons
- fix buttons stuck on hover color when clicked
- css variables for more dynamicness
- better class names
